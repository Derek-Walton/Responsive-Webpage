## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using media queries to accomodate for different screen sizes and adjust content accordingly.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
    main{
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 90%;
        height: 50%;
    }
}
```
